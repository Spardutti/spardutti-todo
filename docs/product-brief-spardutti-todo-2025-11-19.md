# Product Brief: spardutti-todo

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Author:** Spardutti
**Context:** Personal utility tool

---

## Executive Summary

A minimal, locally-stored todo application for personal task management. Create todos, mark them complete, and bulk-delete completed items. No cloud, no complexity - just what's needed.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Existing todo applications are over-engineered for simple task tracking needs. They require internet connections, come loaded with features that create friction, and disrupt workflow. The core need is ultra-fast task capture - alt-tab in, create a todo, alt-tab out and get back to work. Current solutions make this simple action unnecessarily complex.

### Proposed Solution

A minimal desktop todo application with local file storage. Optimized for speed and simplicity:
- Instant launch and task entry
- Local data storage (no internet required)
- Create todos with minimal input
- Mark todos complete/incomplete
- Bulk delete all completed items
- Zero configuration, zero bloat

The app stays out of your way - quick access when needed, invisible when not.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

Developers and professionals who maintain flow state while working. They need to capture tasks quickly without context-switching overhead. They value:
- Speed over features
- Local control over cloud convenience
- Keyboard-driven workflows
- Tools that disappear until needed

Built primarily for personal use, but applicable to anyone who prioritizes minimal friction in task capture.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features

The MVP includes only what's essential:

1. **Create Todos** - Fast text entry for new tasks
2. **Mark Complete/Incomplete** - Toggle todo status with a click or keyboard shortcut
3. **Delete Completed** - Bulk action to clear all completed items
4. **Local Storage** - All data stored locally on the PC (no cloud, no accounts)
5. **Minimal UI** - Clean, distraction-free interface optimized for speed

Success criteria: Can alt-tab in, create a todo, and alt-tab out in under 2 seconds.

---

## Technical Preferences

**Target Platform:** Windows (primary)

**Technology Considerations:**
- Electron was the initial idea (leverages web technologies, familiar tooling)
- Open to alternatives that optimize for speed and simplicity
- Key requirement: Fast startup and minimal resource footprint

The technology choice should prioritize the core goal: instant access and zero friction.
